year	description
2008	That was a pretty good year! Obama won the presidency, <b>Shark Tank</b> celebrated its fifth season, and <b>Woody Allen married his step-daughter!</b> Ahh so much happened. We were all so young (especially Woody Allen's step-daughter. Oy what a creep.)
2009	Another solid year! I <b>graduated high school</b> in 2009. Remember <b>senior skip day?</b> That was a good time. We all went to <b>Crane Beach in Gloucester</b> and had a grand old time. <b>Sandy Marzilli</b> even brought beer. What a rebel!
2010	This year was totally fine, I think. College was fun but the beginning was a little tough. I spent this summer complaining about how I wasn't getting shifts to scoop ice cream at <b>J.P. Licks.</b>
2011	This was <b>not a real year.</b>
