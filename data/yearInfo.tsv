2009	In 2009, <b>Google</b> started the <b>first self-driving car company</b> via their special projects division, Google X. They went on a <b>hiring spree</b> and shuffled around people onto the project internally. In a few years, many of these hires will have started their own companies. <b>Tesla</b> also hired people to build <b>semi-autonomous features</b> like Autosteer, Auto Lane Change, and Autopark.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, <b>startups</b> began to pop up that worked on <b>auxiliary tasks</b> like digital maps and AI.
2011	From 2011 to 2012, the autonomous vehicle industry was still a <b>sleeping giant.</b> Founder of Google X and DARPA race participant <b>Sebastian Thrun</b> left Google to <b>found Udacity</b>, an education company that would eventually teach courses on building autonomous vehicles.<br/><br/>The startups that were founded in this time were still working on auxillary tasks rather than building fully autonomous vehicles.
2013	In 2013, <b>startups working on fully autonomous vehicles</b> began to get founded. <b>Peter Rawlinson</b> left Tesla to <b>found Lucid Motors</b> and serial entrepeneur Kyle Vogt joined Daniel Kan to found <b>Cruise Automation</b>.<br/><br/>Both companies worked on driverless cars and aspired to see <b>big buyouts</b> of their companies. Within three years, one of them would see their aspiration fulfilled.
2014	In 2014, the <b>Chinese tech companies</b> started to show interest in the autonomous vehicle space. <b>Alibaba acquired AutoNavi</b> to improve their navigation abilities. Within a year of the acquisition, they started working with Chinese automaker SAIC Motor to put cars on the road.<br/><br/>Tom Wessner and Nick Sampson started Faraday Future, the <b>second self-driving car startup</> to come out of <b>Tesla</b> employees.
2015	The industry started to heat up in 2015. <b>Big companies acquired their way in</b> by buying mapping companies and rumors started to swarm about <b>Apple</b> starting a secret car project entitled "Project Titan."<br/><br/>Established car companies including <b>Ford</b> and <b>GM</b> saw the writing on the wall and began their own self-driving carinitiatives as well. The desire to <b>protect trade secrets</b>, a recurring theme in this story, makes it difficult to date exactly when these larger companies started their initiatives.
2016	In 2016, the <b>acquisition madness</b> struck. <b>Cruise Automation</b> was acquired for a jaw dropping <b>$1 billion.</b> <b>Renault-Nissan</b> and <b>GM</b> made major acquisitions as well.</b><br/><br/>Meanwhile, high level employees at the major tech companies were <b>leaving in droves to start their own companies.</b> Four <b>Google employees</b> left to start <b>Otto</b>, two <b>Uber employees</b> and a Google employee started <b>Argo AI</b>, and <b>Chris Urmson</b> left Tesla to start <b>Aurora Innovation</b>, the third autonomous vehicle startup out of Tesla. To end the year, Google changed the name of its self-driving car division to <b>Waymo.</b>
2017	As of May, 2017 has already seen <b>major acquisitions</b> in self-driving cars. <b>Uber acquired Otto</b> and its valuable former Google employees for an estimated $680 million and <b>Ford invested $1 billion in Argo AI</b>, claiming a majority stakehold in the company.<br/><br/>This year has also seen the start of <b>lawsuits</b> over data theft. <b>Anthony Levandowski</b> has been <b>accused by Google</b> of stealing 14,000 confidential files from Google and bringing them to Uber via Otto. <b>Sterling Anderson</b> has been <b>accused by Tesla</b> of stealing hundreds of gigabytes of data for his new company <b>Aurora Innovation</b>, which was started by his former co-worker, Chris Urmson.
